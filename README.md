## END TO END ML PROJECT

### Overview

- This is a student performance prediction application designed to predict the academic performance of students based on various input parameters such as demographics, family background, study habits, etc. The application has been developed end-to-end with the reference of Krish Naik's videos, covering data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and integration.

- The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This README provides detailed information on how to use the application, its features, and links for accessing the deployed application.

### Features

- Prediction: Users can input student details such as age, gender, family size, study time, etc., and the application will predict the student's performance based on the trained machine learning model.

- Ease of Use: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily input data and obtain predictions.

- Scalability: Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the application can handle multiple requests concurrently and scales automatically based on traffic.

- Integration: Integrated with AWS CodePipeline for automated deployment, ensuring efficient and consistent updates to the application.

### How to Use

- Accessing the Application: You can access the application using the following link:
[Student Performance Prediction Application](http://studentperformance1-env.eba-jnjdtbpk.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

- Inputting Data: Once you access the application, you will be presented with a form where you can input various parameters related to the student.

- Predicting Performance: After entering the required data, click on the "Predict" button. The application will process the input and display the predicted performance of the student.

- View Prediction Data: Additionally, you can view the raw data used for prediction by visiting the following link:

### Deployment

- The application is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline. The deployment process ensures that any changes made to the application are automatically built, tested, and deployed to the production environment without manual intervention.

### Support and Feedback

- If you encounter any issues while using the application or have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to reach out to the developer.
